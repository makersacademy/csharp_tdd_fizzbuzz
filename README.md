# C# TDD FizzBuzz

This repo accompanies our introduction to C#. You can either dip into it at a specific stage or work through from start to finish.

If you want to work through the whole thing, start by watching, and following along with, stages 1 and 2. Then try to do each of the following stages before watching the video.

## Rules of FizzBuzz

You probably know the rules by now but here's a recap.

FizzBuzz is a counting game where:
* numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with the word "Fizz"
* numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with the word "Buzz"
* numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with the word "FizzBuzz"
* all other numbers remain as they are

So the FizzBuzz sequence up to 15 is:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```

## Stages

This application was developed in 6 stages. Each stage was recorded and a commit was made at the end, so you can revisit the codebase as it was at that point.

## 1. Initial setup
> Create the solution and projects that will be used to implement FizzBuzz
- [Code](https://github.com/makersacademy/csharp_tdd_fizzbuzz/tree/0cf1ad26d3cd17b0ff4736e712097bb989b7d3c7)
- [Video](https://youtu.be/95qy7A7eQuU)
## 2. First test failing ðŸš§
> Write a test for numbers that are not divisible by 3 or 5
- [Code](https://github.com/makersacademy/csharp_tdd_fizzbuzz/tree/02af019553db339d5ed7ebdd8833163755befca6)

## 3. First test passing âœ…
> Write just enough code to get the test passing
- [Code](https://github.com/makersacademy/csharp_tdd_fizzbuzz/tree/578660789245f6a88db598f59a5c901723f986fc)

## 4. Fizz âœ…
> Test drive the next feature, which deals with numbers divisible by 3
- [Code](https://github.com/makersacademy/csharp_tdd_fizzbuzz/tree/169e58a656682f12d38930caeef3505c88d7d844)

- [Video - Part 2](https://youtu.be/yfuWnUuC9v0)
## 5. Buzz and FizzBuzz âœ…
> Test drive the next two features, which deal with numbers divisible by 5 and numbers divisible by 15
- [Code](https://github.com/makersacademy/csharp_tdd_fizzbuzz/tree/21d8fb9e34594faa33466ee9f61e93984cc1ec6c)

## 6. Customisable FizzBuzz âœ…
> Test drive a version of FizzBuzz that can be customised to use any two 'sounds' in place of Fizz and Buzz
- [Code](https://github.com/makersacademy/csharp_tdd_fizzbuzz/tree/77e7161b626897fe63eb6a3b47b2b41a723ed815)
